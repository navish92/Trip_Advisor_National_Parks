      "Review:  I've never been especially enthusiastic about stuff like camping or the Great Outdoors in general, but Yosemite Valley really is a magical place. And to get the full effect you have to do at least one or two of the day hikes that ascend from the valley floor. Vernal Fall, for example, is only visible after you make a two- mile hike up a narrow,rugged, serpentine gorge east of the main valley.

It's not a big river, but what it lacks in size it more than makes up for in fury.) At the top of the staircase the trail makes a hairpin turn around a towering cliff and Vernal Fall comes into view. The cliff recedes away from you and curves to the left, forming a sort of sheer-sided half-bowl. Near the far end of the bowl the Merced roars off the top of the cliff and plunges straight down three hundred feet, making a huge cloud of spray that hovers in the bowl, like a watery genie. Because I was there so early in the year, many of the Park trails were still closed. So, obviously, I didn't see everything the Park has to offer.

      "Review:  Yosemite Valley is stunning and the waterfalls are wonderful. It is however extremely crowded in the summer and we found the bus service not as efficient as other places we visited.

It is high elevation area so snow is also heavy in this area and impossible for the road to be cleared.  For the first few snows of the winter, it is sometimes just a temporary closure.

      "Review:  The Mist Trail is a fantastically popular and difficult trail. I would venture to say that this is the most popular trail for tourists in the park. I have seen very small children and elderly people venture this trail - and I so commend them because this trail is definitely on the strenuous list. When you begin at Happy Isles, you will walk across the bridge and to the trailhead. At this point, it is quite literally all uphill from there. You are walking on a paved trail uphill and your first stop is the footbridge. Stop on the footbridge and enjoy the view of Vernal Falls and grab a drink of water while your at it. There is also a restroom and a place to sit on some old tree stumps and eat some lunch. Don't forget to pack in what you pack out and NEVER feed the wildlife. This takes a lot away from there natural sources of food. Be respectful please. After you have stopped to relax and have bite, you will continue on uphill until you arrive at the granite staircases. At this point, it becomes incredibly strenuous. But if you continue on your will be rewarded heavily with a view of Vernal Falls. If you can brave it and continue your trek forward to the top of Vernal you will see the Emerald Pools. This can be extremely dangerous so never swim in these. I have personally seen someone fall off of the top of this waterfall. Thankfully a family member of mine was able to grab him. Please do not underestimate these dangerously beautiful waterfalls. The top of Vernal Falls is wonderful but it wasn't as spectacular as the base, in my opinion. If you still have the energy, I highly encourage you to continue on to Nevada Falls and possibly little Yosemite. (I will have other reviews for those areas soon).Word of advice - do not be discouraged as you are climbing up the stairs. Take breaks often and keep trekking. You will not regret it. Consider bringing trekking poles for your hike down. This will help a lot with stability. Happy Trails! \n",
      "Review:  There aren't really any \"bad\" parts of Yosemite, but some things appeal to certain people more than other things might.  The Mist Trail is a beautiful trail that will appeal to nearly everyone.  There's the first part of the trail, which is a bit hilly but paved and can be accessed by most people of moderate ability, including families with strollers and very young children.  Once you get to the bridge, the trail becomes much more challenging, including a steep climb up slippery rock stairs/steps, which leads to the top of Vernal Falls.  The mist from Vernal Falls is very heavy, so if you do the climb all the way up to the top, dress accordingly--shoes with good traction are a must!  Like most attractions in Yosemite Valley, it can get very crowded in the summer.  The steepest part of the trail can be challenging, but I saw kids (under 12) racing past me up the trail. The high altitude and tough climb often left me breathless, and towards the top of the trail I had to stop frequently. The view from the top of Vernal Falls is definitely worth the strenuous hike.  Don't forget to bring water (you can refill your bottles at the bridge), sunscreen, and maybe a lunch to enjoy at the top of the falls.\n",

      "Review:  First, the huge sequoia trees in Mariposa Grove are awesome.  Since the park is large and we have a small kid, we decide to take the tram ride.  It costs $25 per adult.  Not cheap.  But, it is really fun to ride the tram and they provide an audio headset for the tour.  The tram ride has two 10-minute stops.  It is mainly for bathroom break.  10-minute is just not enough if you want to take some pictures. If you want to spend more time at the stop, you are allowed to return the headset to the driver and hop to the next tram.  Here is the problem.  We visit this place in a long weekend and the whole park is packed with people.  We take the 11am tram.  There are a large crowd arriving by tour bus after we have bought our tickets.  By the time we finish the tour, I hear the lady in the ticket booth saying that the tickets for the next few tours are all sold out.  So, if you decide to have an extended stay at the stop, there may not have any empty seat available for the return trip.  You will have to walk/hike back down to the entrance.  Not great if you have small kids.  Be warned.  Anyway, we really enjoy the short hike near the entrance.\n",
      "Review:  This is a fantastic short hike (4 miles round trip?) from Happy Isles trailhead.  Just be aware that whether you get \"misted\" or \"soaked like turning over a bucket\" depends on when you visit this trail.

      "Review:  The Mist Trail Hike in Yosemite is a fairly strenuous hike to the top of Nevada Falls (approx. 3 Miles to the top, with an elevation gain close to 2000).  The Mist Trail starts out with a crowd at the bottom, but thins out the higher you hike.  A lot of people will only hike the paved trail to the bottom of the Vernal Falls, others will hike the granite stairs to the top of Vernal Falls, and some continue on from Vernal Falls to the top of Nevada Falls.  While the bottom was extremely crowded, by the time we were on the trail between the two falls, there were not many hikers at all.The scenery is awesome the enitre way.  There are many great views from the bottom, top, and along the sides of both falls.  The views of the granite summits surrounding you on all sides when you reach the top are really beautiful.  Sitting and relaxing at the top of Nevada Falls with your feet soaking in the cold Merced River is a great place to be.I recommend taking the John Muir Trail on the way down.  It is slightly longer, but the more gradual incline of the switchbacks makes it a bit easier.  This really is a great hike, so don't rush it.  Spend some time at the top of each falls.\n",

      "Review:  Most people will pile out of their cars or tour buses and walk the paved trail over flat land to the base of the lower falls.  That's great, as the walk is easy and the view is great.The other hike will take you away from the camera-toting tourists from the buses and reward the true hiker with even better views.  It is however, not for the unprepared.Once you've marched down the easy path with 1000 of your new friends, go back to the start and head west to find the Upper Yosemite Falls trailhead.  Signs obviously cost a lot in Yosemite since you won't find any until you get to the trailhead.  Just head west and keep going until you're almost to Camp 4.Once at the trailhead, be prepared for 2700 feet of elevation gain to go all the way up.  This will take you a good 6 hours to travel the 7.6 miles straight up endless switchbacks and inclines.But wait, you don't have to go all the way to be rewarded!After about an hour of grueling switchbacks, you will reach a beautiful point with a pipe railing.  This will reward you with views of the whole valley with Glacier Point opposite your position.  Go a little farther, and you'll be able to see the falls.Check out the Park Service videos here for more views and info:http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/valleyhikes.htm---- Oh, and please don't be that idiot starting the hike to the Upper Falls in tennis shoes and carrying a tiny bottle of water, or no water at all.  This is a real hike uphill all the way with plenty of chances to become dehydrated or twist an ankle.\n",
      "Review:  The trail to Upper Yosemite Fall was very difficult for us (60 and 55 years old) but the effort was rewarded with magnificent views.  There were a good number of hikers the day we climbed but the trail never seemed crowded.  We enjoyed sitting at the top of the climb just above the fall and shared our experience with a number of other people. The trail is well maintained and the National Park Service should be given lots of credit for being able to maintain so many miles of trails at altitude.  The hike to the top and back took us just over 6 hours but we were definitely on the slower side.  Some folks were making it to the top in 2 hr.  Take lots of snacks and especially lots of water if it is a hot day.  The Lower Yosemite Fall was a disappointment because there were so many people there that one could hardly get a picture without a thousand people in the way of the fall.  We were there on Memorial Day and that is supposed to be the busiest day of the year and we believe it.  The days after Memorial Day were much less crowded and more enjoyable.   \n",
      "Review:  This is a challenging 3 mile hike. Even at the start it is rather steep until you get to the footbridge .This is where the last water refilling station is until you get to the top. Make sure you refill your water bottle , you will need it ! The next part of the hike is harder with steps all the way but you will really get WET from the mist, it is almost like rain. You really have to watch your step as one wrong footing can end up with a bad fall as the steps are rather slippery. Please make sure your camera is well protected as mine was soaking wet ! There were lot of people having difficulty climbing up so make sure you take plenty of water and stop when you need it. Once you get to the top you will realize that it is worth the climb. It is a beautiful spot for a picnic. There are enough rocks near emerald pool , where you can sit and just relax . Be mindful if you have small kids as they want to do nothing other than jump into the water . Although emerald pool looks very calm ,people have been swept over the waterfalls to their death in seconds, so do not get into the water. I was horrified to find people jump over the safety rails and ignore warnings at the top of the falls to take photographs.\n",
      "Review:  As spectacular as the lush greenery and countless majestic rock formations of the famous Yosemite Valley are, the spectacular vistas afforded to visitors of this magical place would be lacking something very special without the countless waterfalls that cascade down from the valley's granite peaks year-round. Housing some of the world's most famous waterfalls, Yosemite is made truly unique by these natural wonders that seem somehow to grace every look one has from and at the valley. In total, there are dozens of waterfalls when counted in the springtime or after a large rainstorm, as smaller falls appear as outlets for the abundance of water during these times. However normally, there are five main, easily-accessible waterfalls: Yosemite Falls, Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and Silhouette Falls. All of these provide incomparable and memorable views and are not to be missed during your visit to the valley! Yosemite Falls is actually three separate waterfalls in one - technically making it a \"falls\" and not a \"waterfall.\" Altogether the falls rank as the sixth highest waterfall in the world, making them a truly unforgettable site for all of the park's more than 3.5 million visitors a year. The falls are fed by the Yosemite River, which flows for many miles along the upper regions of the park near the Tioga region and Eagle Creek Meadow before dropping dramatically over a small V-shaped \"hanging valley\" in the granite cliffs into the Yosemite Valley.  The Upper Falls, dropping a total of 1430 feet total, are the most easily-visible section of these falls. Grabbing the honor of being one of the 20 highest waterfalls in the world, this section's misty plunge is one of the most frequently photographed falls in the park and cannot be missed! The middle section of the falls is the hardest to spot, as it is a series of cascades down craggy rocks, not an actual waterfall. The Yosemite Falls trail is the only way you can catch a glimpse of these hidden wonders, but the trail is very dangerous and slippery due to this mist of the Upper Falls' descent. The lower falls are easily accessible via a viewing area right next to the base of the falls. This is as close as you may ever be able to get to the base of a waterfall without actually getting wet - so savor the experience! During the winter, an incredible cone of ice called \"frazil ice\" forms at the bottom of Yosemite Falls as ice attached to the cliff next to the Upper Falls breaks off and crashes dramatically to the bottom. This was first documented by naturalist John Muir when he compared it to the sound of reverberating thunder in his journals. Vernal Falls, although smaller, is just as worthy of visiting. Falling a total of somewhere between 250 and 300 feet, it does not break any height barriers, but its wide curtain of water makes it a majestic destination for all visitors. Easily accessible via the Mist Trail, the path takes hikers directly through the mist created by the rushing falls. If it is a time of heavy runoff you could be completely drenched by the time you make it through! This is one of the shortest and most popular trails in the park and is of only moderate difficulty.  Nevada Falls forms the upper half of a two-part fall, with the lower half being the aforementioned Vernal Falls. This connection is sometimes referred to as the \"giant staircase,\" because when viewed from lookouts like Glacier Point, which affords viewers a spectacular view of both falls, the combination looks like an enormous staircase. To reach Nevada Falls, one must take an additional 2-mile hike directly uphill from the top of Vernal Falls, but once there you can attain a spectacular vista of the valley and the Falls alike. One should be advised that although there are pools directly before both sections of this cascade spills over, and that many more foolish visitors enjoy taking a \"dip\" in the pools, doing so is highly unwise, as there are dangerous undercurrents mostly invisible to the average viewer. Bridal Veil Fall is almost as famous as Yosemite Falls, in that it is very easily and dramatically viewed from many points in the valley. This is probably the most clear-cut example of a \"hanging valley\" fall among all Yosemite National Park's waterfalls. When the main Sherwin Age glacier that moved through Yosemite Valley existed, tributary glaciers joined into it from the higher sides of the valley, creating sloped, V-shaped wedges that now host many of Yosemite's waterfalls. They get their name because when the wind is blowing very hard, the falls' relatively lighter flow is blown dramatically sideways and its resulting mist appears must as a bride's veil.\n",

      "Review:  Walking to the top of Upper Yosemite Falls was one of the most enjoyable experiences of my recent trip to California. Despite being tired at the end of a six hour round-trip, this was well worth it. My wife and I visited Yosemite valley in late March, and the weather could not have been more ideal, the ascent was cool but sunny, and at the top there was still plenty of snow making for some beautiful scenes. The waterfall itself was in full flow. The trail is not easy, and some will be unable to complete it. However, there are some amazing views at the halfway point, which are worth seeing as well. If you can make it to the top though, it's well worth the effort. I'd recommend taking proper hiking boots, although some people seemed to be coping with trainers - they were just slipping on the ice/snow a lot more. If you only have one day in Yosemite valley (in Spring at least), I'd really suggest this trail is the choice you make!\n",

      "Review:  The scale of everything in Yosemite is hard to describe.  The 3000 foot walls rising from the valley are beyond words.  The giant sequoias of the Mariposa Grove are the same way and create a counterpoint to the rest of Yosemite. If you enter the park from the south you will drive right by it: stop and take a hike through the grove (although you may need to drive another 6 miles to the Wawona Hotel to get a shuttle to the grove).  If you entered from the west or east it is worth the one hour drive from the valley to see these trees.  Hard not to think of John Muir hiding behind each one.\n",
      "Review:  It is really tempting to rush this route in a bid to get to the Valley before all the parking lots fill up. Don't -- the early morning sunlight gives a very different view to that you'll get on the return later in the day. It's refreshingly cool up at Tuolumne Meadows, at Mono Lake etc, and there's a higher chance of seeing wildlife (ie bears) in this less-visited part of the park. Enjoy the route up before the park entry station too, the drive is terrific.\n",
      "Review:  Tioga Pass! 9945ft elevation! Wow. We drove through here on our way to Lake Tahoe from Yosemite and it was breathtaking. Seeing all the snow was such a big change from the sunny roads of Yosemite and the views were fantastic. Amazing how they managed to build a road here! We pulled over at the side and took a lot of photos of the mountains and the views. Never thought I'd have photos of myself in shorts and a tshirt in the snow! Definitely worth driving through!\n",

      "Review:  The drive to Glacier point is well worth it for the views of the valley, Yosemite Falls, Half Dome and Vernal/ Nervada Falls. Glacier point is well equipped with restrooms and a shop/ cafe where you can buy souvenirs and light snacks (sandwiches, crisp and ice creams, hot and cold drinks). There is quite a large car park but in peak season it would get full rather quickly therefore we recommend going early; if you have an RV drive through the loop car park and there is space for approx 6 RVs at the top before you rejoin the road you entered on. The trails to the main view points are short and accessible for all abilities and can accommodate strollers/ wheelchairs. \n",

      "Review:  Went up Half Dome in early June of 2014. A fair bit of warning, this is not an easy hike. It wild test your resolve. That being said, if you are semi-active you can do this. Its just a matter of how long you want to be exposed to the elements. The best advice I can give for the night before is drink lots of water. I drank 1.5 liters an hour before bed. I then drank another 1.5 liters at our 4 AM wake up call. I easily drank 6-7 liters during the hike and probably could have drank more.We started at the trail head at around 5 AM, since it was June, we didn't need flashlights. The first part of the trail is a slowly raising grade of paved trail. You will get to the falls bridge and reach a water fountain. I drank as much as I possibly could while there, because you are about start gaining elevation. We took the Mist Trail up and down, which is considered the more difficult route. If stamina or knees are a concern, you can bypass the Falls and take a slower but longer trail up part ways. It would be a shame though, as missing Vernal or Nevada Falls would be a shame. After a few hours of stairs and other granite steps, you will be at the top Nevada Falls. Its a perfect place to stop and take a break. A good piece of advice is take food that you will enjoy eating. I took cashews, granola, craisons, m&ms, jerky and a few Snickers bars. Drink lots of water and apply sunscreen.From Nevada Falls, you will enter little Yosemite Valley. In the morning its a quick jaunt through a cool mountain valley. At the end, you will start gaining election with a long winding path which takes you to the Sub Dome. This is the area I had the most trouble. Its a constant grade so its hard to take a break. Its devious in that its most of the time the grade is slight, but it just keeps coming. This is going to be the end of tree coverage; apply sunscreen!Eventually you will get out of the trees and be at the beginning of the Sub Dome. The Sub Dome is very sheer, you are climbing stairs and on all sides are sheer drops. Take your time, and pay attention to where you step. At the very end of the sub dome, the stairs end, and leave you with very little direction as where to go. You have about 100 yards of granite to move up and you will be at the Saddle. Nothing is going to prepare you for the site of seeing the cables. Its pretty much pulling yourself up a wall. Take it slow, use the cables(pushing down on them while lifting yourself up) and take gloves. The top is indescribable. The sense of accomplishment you get is truly amazing. But you are only halfway there. Getting down is faster, but a bit scarier. Its easiest to go down facing backwards. Here is the only place on the tail where you have to truly trust others. Going down, a man yanked a pole out and proceeded to have a bit of a freak out. Someone had to go and put the pole back in. Be smart, and courteous; you will be faster than some, but slower than others.Going down the Sub Dome is just as precious as going up. Be careful, and use your hiking poles, if you have some(get some!), they will save wear on your knees and give you balance.In the afternoon, Little Yosemite Valley is a lot hotter and more dusty, so water is key. We had to stop at the Merced River and get more water. We used a charcoal filter. Once you get to the end of the Valley, you will start running into more traffic. Nevada Falls is considered a tough day hike, so there will be a lot of people stopping there and resting before making their descent. This part seems a lot steeper. Be careful and watch out for slippery steps. The rest of the trail gets easier. Once at the water fountain, drink up and its an easy paved trail down. Once down, celebrate with a beer, or other beverage of choice and you are guaranteed, whatever you eat, will be the best meal you had in months!\n",
      "Review:  It's quite a drive to Glacier Point but such a pretty one.   We started here and worked our way back and we're glad we did.  Arrive early - really early.  We arrived at Yosemite at 8am and were at Glacier Point for just before 9 and parking was filling up.    The views are out of this world. You can walk down from here but bear in mind there's currently no shuttle to bring you back up!   So we did half that slightly steep walk and turned back.  Don't miss Glacier Point if you're going to Yosemite. The scale is mind-blowing.  There's a nice gift shop that sells ices and drinks there too.  \n",
      "Review:  Glacier Point is a famous viewpoint above Yosemite Valley.  It is located on the south wall of Yosemite Valley at an elevation of 7,214 feet (2199 meters), 3,200 feet (975 meters) above Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village).  It is accessible by car from approximately late May through October or November (depending on snow conditions).  From mid-December through March, it is only accessible by cross-country skiers.There are three primary ways to get to Glacier Point; the first is by driving.  Assuming the roads are open, you can take Wawona Road (the continuation of Highway 41 within the Park) and turn on to the Glacier Point Road at the Chinquapin intersection.  Parking is available at Glacier Point, as are rest rooms and a gift shop/snack stand.The second way to access Glacier Point is by hiking there.  NOTE that there are no easy or moderate hiking trails to Glacier Point from Yosemite Valley, so this should only be attempted by fit and experienced hikers.  Most hikers from the Valley will take the challenging Four Mile Trail, which is actually 4.8 miles (7.7 km) one way.  NOTE that there is no free shuttle service between Glacier Point and Yosemite Valley, so the majority of hikers return to the Valley on foot via either the Four Mile Trail or the 8.5 mile (13.5 km) Panorama Trail.  It is possible to catch the Glacier Point Tour Bus back to the Valley, but you should purchase your ticket in advance (verify with the tour company that you can do so) and be very aware of the bus schedule.(Speaking of hiking, the trailhead for several popular trails can be found adjacent to Glacier Point; the Taft Point, Sentinel Dome, Panorama and Pohono Trails all originate there.)The third way to get to Glacier Point is to take the Glacier Point Tour Bus.  You can purchase tickets from the activities desk at the Yosemite Valley Lodge (from which the bus leaves), but I would recommend that you purchase them online ahead of time.  You can purchase either one-way or round trip tickets.  We opted for one-way tickets because we were hiking the Panorama Trail back to the Valley.  Tickets are pricey, but based on our hiking plans they made the most sense.No matter how you get there, by all means make every effort to visit Glacier Point.  If you have a camera with a wide-angle lens or a panoramic setting, you’ll definitely want to employ them here.  Even if you’ve seen photos from Glacier Point before, you will no doubt gasp when you are confronted by the depth and breadth of Yosemite Valley surrounded by its iconic and majestic granite walls.  It is a sight you are unlikely to forget.\n",

      "Review:  We love Glacier Point.  It's worth every minute of the winding road to reach the top.  It's not a difficult walk out to the point where you can survey all of Yosemite Valley below.  Stop on the way up to view the Vernal/Nevada Falls area.  We've often seen bears and other wildlife on the road on the way up, especially in the numerous meadows.  We've also seen very foolish people out of their cars and up close to the bears trying to get a photograph.  Do not forget these are wild animals, please.  One of our favorite things to do at Glacier Point is come for the evening star talk by a ranger.  (Check the schedule in the visitor's guide they give you when you enter the park.) It is fascinating, and you can lie on centuries-old granite as you gaze up at the night sky with no light pollution.  Wonderful!!!\n",
      "Review:  It's crowded, but you have to stop and get a picture if the sky is clear.  Simply magical!  The kids didn't love getting out of the car just to look at the view for one minute, but they will appreciate the photos when they are older. \n",
      "Review:  Left at 7:30am yesterday on Aug 12 from the trailhead parking lot. Weather was perfect. So many people encouraged us the whole way up and we returned the favor to everyone we passed on the way down. It’s a grueling hike but very doable if you have some common sense preparation. I tried to walk 10,000 steps most days a few weeks prior. I also ran on my treadmill 1.5-2.5 miles every other day for three weeks to get my stamina up. I did a local 5 mile hike twice. Make sure you do push-ups and pull ups every other day for 2-3 weeks and you’ll have no problem on the cables. Cables takes a lot of upper body strength. Bring a summit treat to reward yourself. I took some premium milk chocolate. Tastes better at the top!From the bottom of the sub dome to the top of half Dome is .7 miles.Yosemite recommends bringing four liters of water. I think that’s bad advice. Bring 5 liters. I used almost every drop of 5 liters. Better to have a bit more than you need. Also, being a life straw so you can drink river water safely if needed. Don’t be afraid to ask other hikers to borrow something if you forgot it. Most people are really nice. Those who are not - just ignore them and don’t let them ruin your best day ever.Bring a flashlight for sure. Even if you plan to not hike back in the dark - you never know how your hike will go and you’ll regret not bringing a light.Sub dome is more strenuous than the cables. Cables probably take about 30 minutes each way. Yesterday was my second time up. First time was two years ago. Yesterday cables took me 25 going up and 15 down. I was very safe and stayed on the inside of the cables the whole way. Don’t be like the idiot I saw outside the cables plus gleefully yelling for attention while sliding on his grip-less shoes down Half Dome. That guy has a half dome above his shoulders and looking to be a dead dome soon.Make sure you get out of your shell and talk to others on the trail. You will meet amazing people from around the country and the world.Rangers checked permits at the base of the sub dome. Get a permit, don’t go all the way up and get turned around - you’ll regret it. I can’t wait to go a third time. Absolutely beautiful scenery around every corner beautifully painted by a Master artist!!!\n",
      "Review:  After failing to summit 2 years ago (ear infection caused severe vertigo on sub-dome) I chose to have a guided tour on my second attempt (Aug 2019) so that I didn't have to navigate the ridiculously complicated process of getting wilderness permits and half dome permits again. (Hello Silicon Valley!  Can you not help our gov't improve this system!?)  I chose the DiscoveryTreks.com company for their reasonable price and doable 3 night backpack itinerary.  Having someone to cook and clean up after all the meals was really appealing, and our guide Jason did not disappoint!  He was wonderful in both his calm and encouraging demeanor (not easy to keep everyone happy in a group with varying opinions and expectations haha!)  We had two people with us who had never backpacked before, and all of us had our challenges with fitness and knee issues, so Jason really was awesome in how he managed all of our anxieties and fitness issues and still got us to the dome with a great attitude.  Unless you are extremely fit, I do NOT recommend attempting half dome without at least one night in the Little Yosemite Camp site.  Doing it in one day is dangerous unless you are very fit and very prepared.  I highly recommend #DiscoveryTreks.com if you want to climb half dome but don't want the hassle of figuring out all the logistics on your own.  These guys will get you there safely and will take a lot of the burden out of the trip.  We started the hike via Mono Meadows after spending our first night at North Pine backpackers campsite in the valley floor.  We woke up early to catch a tour bus (you must have tickets) to Glacier Point, and then hopped back on same bus to Mono Meadows trailhead. It was a nice bonus to get a tour of Glacier Point and our bus driver Colette (I think?) was hysterical!   From Mono Meadows we had an easy 3 hr hike to our campsite on the Illilouette creek where we swam and relaxed in virtual solitude.  I recommend water proof hiking shoes by the way, as we had a very wet meadow crossing at one point.  From there the next morning we hiked into Little Yosemite Valley via the Panorama Trail and John Muir Trail, which afforded amazingly beautiful views without the steep climb of the mist trail.  Arriving before lunch we had time to swim in the Merced and rest before eating lunch (Jason is a great cook!) and then preparing for the Half Dome climb.  We started out before 2pm and arrived at the cables about 3.5hrs later.  Lots of breaks on the way up due to high heat and just our fitness levels.  The sub-dome was particularly challenging for me because it is steep and does not have railings.  Not recommended for folks with vertigo!  It was not a long ascent though, and we reached the cables within maybe 30 minutes.  The cable route is very steep and way scarier than I imagined, but thankfully there were very few hikers on it that late in the afternoon.  We arrived at cables around 5:30 I think.  I was not going to attempt them until the ranger there said they aren't as bad as they look.  He was wrong, haha, but by the time I started going up there was no turning back.  Having the cable on each side of your body is reassuring, especially with good gloves and hiking shoes gripping well, but there are sections where you are walking up very steep slick rock with a cliff on each side of you and it is not for the faint of heart.  They have wood planks to stop on every 10 or 15 feet, which helps you get some rest and feel more secure on the cliff.  It takes around 30 mins to climb if you don't have others holding you up on the cables, but it is definitely hard on your arms and back since you are pulling your weight up equally between your arms and legs.  I advise ascending the cables without looking to either side of you as you are definitely close to the cliff at several points.  Arriving at the top was so worth all of the pain and fright though!  It is otherworldly on top, with stunning 360 degree views.  So peaceful that time of day too.  The sun was starting to set so that the light was gorgeous on the valley.  Coming down the cables was also quite frightening, but maybe not as bad as going up since you knew what to expect and had gravity helping you.  There are a few rock shelves to step down and these are quite disconcerting if you are short since you have to reach up higher to the cable in these sections, but overall the descent is quick if no one is holding up the line.  Going down the sub-dome was way easier for me than up, and we were on the main trail home in no time.  However, the trail back to LYV camp is long and it is critical to carry extra water and snacks and MOST IMPORTANT a light!  We were at our campsite before dark, but not much before it.  We saw several people coming up on our way down who did not have water or headlamps and we heard later that one of them had to be helped by others on the trail.  Don't be a burden to others and make sure you prepare properly for this hike!  It is not cool to assume you are so special you don't need water or headlamps to attempt the dome.  The next morning we broke camp and headed back to the valley floor via the John Muir trail.  It took around 3.5hrs.  Lots of switchbacks and sore knees but well worth the effort.  We chose to splurge on a final night at the Ahwahnee with a dinner reservation planned in advance.  A great end to a fantastic adventure!  Thanks to Jason and DiscoveryTreks!\n",
      "Review:  We visited Yosemite in mid May, hoping to enjoy our trails in full spring weather.What we got was a winterish weather, and the morning when we chose to do the Yosemite Falls Trail it was raining slightly... when we got to the base of the falls, it started to snow.. heavily! It was wonderful... plus, it was my first time ever witnessing snow (where I live we don´t get snow in winter)... so you can imagine how dazzled I was. A lady said to me \"Merry Christmas!\" when she saw the expression in my face hahaha. Never had I seen something so powerful and beautiful.. the Yosemite falls were in their full power, thundering against the rock as the ice was falling from the sky.

      "Review:  We toured Yosemite, but the sequoias were the major attraction for us, and we stayed in a hotel near the south entrance so we could see them first. There is a large parking lot where you will catch the shuttle that takes you into the grove itself. The welcome plaza has a gift shop and restrooms. If you have a handicap plate, you can drive directly to the entrance of the grove and skip the shuttle. Likewise, if you arrive before or after shuttle hours, you can drive directly. You will then take a trail around the grove. There are three, ranging from easy to strenuous. We did the grizzly loop (moderate) in order to see the walk-through tree and the Grizzly, and it was uphill the whole way up. The trails are well marked. The trees are amazing! Make sure to go early or late to get the best photos without a bunch of other people in them.\n",

Park at the Pioneer Village in Wawona.  There is a free shuttle that will take you to Mariposa Grove, and back.  Shuttles are air conditioned & available about every 20 minutes, until 7:00 pm.3.  Bring your own water (and snacks if you think you will need them).  The gift stores there are expensive.4.  Be sure to check out Pioneer Village, especially if you are there Wed-Sun.5.  A 1 1/4 hour open tram tour of the upper grove (a long hike) is narrated in 5 languages & costs $26.50 per person.  That osunds like a lot, until you see the prices of the gift shop items, such as $20. for a t-shirt.6.  The walking tour is free (except for the park entrance fee, if applicable).We have a home in Wawona & went there 3 times in the last 10 days with guests.\n",
      "Review:  We visited years ago.  There is now a bus that takes you to the grove entrance.  There is a large parking lot to park your car and a lovely welcome plaza with restrooms and of course, a gift shop.  We hiked to Wawona Point, about a 4 hour round trip hike if you are fit. If you hike at a slower pace, allow up to six hours round trip.  Once you get past the loop trail (.5 mile or so), the crowds thin and you can experience the true peace and quiet of the grove. Hiking beyond the loop gives visitors the opportunity to see uniquely named trees such as the Clothespin tree and the Faithful Couple, as well as spectacular views from Wawona Point. There is a restroom (no running water) about half way up the trail. An exceptional experience for those who have the time and stamina to hike the distance. \n",

      "Review:  The most rewarding path to get to Glacier Point is by walking up the 4 mile trail which is accessed from the Valley floor on Southside Drive just a 3 minute walk south of the Swinging Bridge & picnic area. if you arrive fairly early you should be able to park on the side of the road very close to the 4 mile trailhead. There were still some spaces at 9am on a Sunday in November. This is an amazing hike! It took us around 3.5 hours to make it to Glacier Point from here. It is not steep as such, just a very long gradually climbing hike but the views of the Valley and Upper Yosemite fall on your way up are more than worth it! If Glacier Point Road is closed which it is during winter then the 4 mile trail may be your only way to reach the astounding view of Glacier Point. Otherwise you can 'cheat' and get there from Glacier Point Rd. on a bus, car or bike if the road is open. It took about 2.5 hours to walk back down the 4 mile trail again. Its much easier going down! The view from up there has to be one of the best views on Planet Earth. If you think Tunnel View is impressive you need to see the view from Glacier Point!!!\n",

We were surprised to find easy parking in the visitor lot and bought tickets for the 1:15 open-air tram ride. The wait for the next tram was 45 minutes, but don't miss this. We had packed lunch and water and enjoyed a picnic while we waited for our tour. The tram tour is done by audio with headsets (in the language you chose) and is excellent. The tram makes several photo stops going up and longer stops on the way back. You can walk back down an easy trail through the sequoias. There is a small gift shop near the parking area.

      "Review:  Giant Sequoia trees dominate this part of Yosemite; not to be mistaken with Sequoia National Park, they are two separate entities. We arrived in the park early enough so we could not check into our hotel, we decided to go see the first stop on our map. We drove into the park after purchasing our annual pass, the grove is a short drive from the main entrance gate. There were a lot of cars and people, but we managed to get parking just fine.Information about the trees and the grove are posted right next to the beginning of the hiking trail. The first thing you see as you get to the parking is this giant sequoia tree with semi red trunk and as tall as your eyes can see above.We decided to hike in and see some of the other trees and learn a little more about them.What was interesting to learn, was that the giant sequoias actually need fire to reproduce. We made stops along the way and saw the 'the Fallen Monarch', which is the giant fallen sequoia as you start the hike. The next stop was the 'Bachelor and three Graces', and then on to the 'Giant Grizzly' the biggest tree in the grove. Down slope from the giant grizzly was the tree with a hole in its trunk.There are plenty of deer in the grove, many are unafraid of people, which I found quite interesting.\n",
      "Review:  We rode the shuttle busses from Wawona.  You can park at the lower grove, but that lot is often full on busy days.  We rode the tram in the grove.  It is somewhat expensive ($26.50 for adults, $25 for seniors and less for children) and can be very  bouncy on the at times uneven pavement of the road, but it takes you to the upper grove.  If you wish to do this, do it now as there are plans to discontinue it, and then seeing the upper grove will require a lot of hiking.  At the upper grove, the tram stops for 10 minutes at the museum, an historic structure.  A short walk from the museum is the restroom building (dating form the CCC perhaps), which contains the only flush toliets and washbaisns in the grove.  The tiolets in the parking lot area are vault tiolets.  You can leave the tram at the museun stop and walk up the trail to the right of where the tram stops to the top of the hill.  There the trail levels out and you can see what it is like to be in the middle of a Giant Sequoia grove.  Few people do this, so it should be peaceful and quiet.  The forest has little understory, so you can see quite a ways into it.  The Sequoias stnad out from the many other trees because of their destive red-orange bark.  You return to the tram stop to catch a later tram.  The tram also stops at the Grizzly Gaint, the largest tree in the grove on the way back down and you can walk back from there to the parking lot.  this will be a broad trail with lots of people on it, so the experience in the upper grove is much nicer.\n",
      "Review:  As this is the first stop in the park for many people it fills up the parking lot quickly, requiring a shuttle from Wawona.  If your plans are flexible, try to arrive before 9am or after 4:30pm and park right at the grove.  The grove is very amazing.  I learned a lot about the history/science of the area while walking around.  You can see a good amount by following the recommended hikes posted on the board depending on how long you would like to spend.  We spent about 1.5 hours here, walking to the California TUnnel tree and back, which was very cool to see.  There is also a tram that brings people through on a tour, but it is very costly and we didn't do it.  Definitely stop in and see this area.  Very cool.\n",
      "Review:  A nice thing about Mariposa Grove is that the trees are quite close to the parking area. Another nice thing is that when that easy accessibility means crowds of people, there are lots of other trails that are much less traveled which will give you a true nature experience among the giant sequoia trees. This is the largest grove of Giant Sequoias in Yosemite, it is near the south (Highway 41) entrance to the park. There are 2 other Giant Sequoia groves in Yosemite, near the northwest (Highway 120) entrance to the park and the Tioga Road junction at Crane Flat. But if you can visit the Mariposa Grove, it is the one to see. I like the Outer Loop Trail on the northeast side of the grove for going in/up, and I always make sure to go all the way to the Wawona Point for the view of the meadow below and surrounding tree covered hills and granite expanses. It's a perfect spot for a picnic lunch in the sun, or there is shade along the trail just below the point when it is hot out. After lunch, I like to take my time visiting the trees of the Upper Grove by continuing on the Outer Loop Trail until I come to the Telescope Tree, then I turn downhill on the trail to the museum (and restrooms). From the museum, I continue down along the Sequoia Walk past other \"named\" trees like the Faithful Couple and the Clothespin Tree, and finally visit the most famous trees of the Lower Grove such as the California Tree and the Grizzly Giant. If you get away from the most heavily used trails in the center of the grove, you may see some wildlife. I've seen quite a few deer, and recently a Pileated Woodpecker hard at work making lots of noise. Once a few years ago, I saw a bear in the distance. And of course squirrels and chipmunks are always ready to greet you with a scolding sound. If you go really early in the morning, or late in the afternoon, you may find a place to park. Even in winter, this is a popular hiking area, the trees are world renowned. Otherwise you must take the shuttle bus from the Wawona General Store / Visitor Center area, this is especially true in summer season.\n",

      "Review:  Depending where you start in the park the hike can be from19 to 22 miles return. You need a permit for the cable section and you apply five months in advance. Some cancellations do become available online and in the park. Did the John Muir trail section up and down to avoid being wet through the mist trail. Easier on the knees but a little longer. Lots of nice people and great scenery too including a close encounter with a bear. Bring rubber gripped gloves for the cables it helps a lot. Views from the top outstanding and throw in the eclipse and you can't beat it.\n",
      "Review:  You start at happy isles and catch the Trail head, which is a long steady climb. Go early and bring lots of water and snacks as it gets hot. When you reach the bridge, you then take the Mist trail, which are granite steps, some 2-3 feet high. Wear good shoes and pay attention. When you get to the top, it's all worth it. Some may be tempted to swim there, but don't. We have seen injuries and there have been deaths from the current taking you over the falls.  You should be somewhat in shape. For me, coming down was more difficult on the steps than going up, mainly because I'm short.\n",
      "Review:  Half Dome is what people think of when they think of Yosemite!  It feels like wherever you go in the park, there it is!  Driving in through tunnel view?  There it is!  Up at Glacier Point?  There it is!  Driving Tioga Pass Road?  There it is!  It really looks like a post card every time you see it :)Don’t forget that 7 days a week you need a permit to hike Half Dome.  You get all of the permits from recreation.gov. ( http://www.recreation.gov/ ) The permits are given out using a lottery system, so just because you apply doesn't mean you'll get one.  If you don't apply when the permits lottery first opens in March you'll have to try & win one of the daily permits.  The daily permits are only available 48 hours before the day you're going hike.  So if you want to hike on Wednesday you need to apply for a permit on Monday.We were lucky enough to win a permit with the regular lottery (but then it rained the day we planned on going up) So we applied for another permit using the daily lottery system & were fortunate enough to win a second permit.  However, the morning we got up to do the hike the clouds were very low & it was raining so we decided not to go up.  Maybe the clouds would have cleared & we could have made it but the risk didn’t seem worth it to us.  Hiking a granite rock 8,000 feet up is very serious!  Rain/storms is not something to mess around with when hiking to the top.With that said, it's not impossible to get a permit so try if you want to do this iconic hike!  I've even heard of people starting the hike & asking other hikers along the way if they have an open slot on their permit (maybe someone decided not to go along after all)  You can hike all the way to the sub-dome without a permit.We trained for 12 weeks prior to going on vacation & I know the hike would have still been very physically demanding.  If you’re going to take the John Muir Trail back down (instead of the Mist Trail) expect to be walking for  16 miles.  For training we walked flat ground in our hiking boots to get our feet ready to be in our boots for so long.  We also cranked the incline up at the treadmill at the gym (incline 11 averages out to the elevation increase during this hike)  And we did as many stair climbers at the gym as we could.  We only ended up going up to Nevada Falls, which is only half way to Half Dome, and by the time we were finished our feet were ready for a rest. Yes, we could have gone further/longer but some of the enjoyment would have definitely been lost.  We had broken in hiking boots & hiking poles which always make a hike much more enjoyable.  We started the hike early, 5:30 a.m., so we were able to park in the close lot.  If you are going to wait & take the shuttle you’ll need to take it to the Happy Isles shuttle stop.Such an amazing park!  Hope you make it to the top!\n",
      "Review:  Having lost out in the pre-season lottery we were stoked to score permits for Half Dome Cables in the daily lottery while already in the valley.There was only light traffic from the trailhead up to the Vernal Falls footbridge, but after that it thinned out and after Nevada Falls we only saw very few people on the trail.Despite the pictures on the internet about hordes of people at the cables we were (pleasantly) surprised that it actually wasn't that crowded (the 3-digit temperatures may have had something to do with it). The ranger posted up there to check permits was dealing with an irrate hiker (probably caught without a permit) and from what we heard from other hikers, he was rude to them. We started the ascent on the cables without him checking our permits and never saw him again when we came down.On the way back there were a few more people on the trail heading down but still without spoiling the overall experience.It was a long, hot day but definitely worth it - try it in 7hrs, 45mins round trip ;-)\n",
      "Review:  This hike is amazing! We got ut at 5.30, and drove to the trailhead parking area at Happy Isles. Myself, my wife and our 12 year old son. We brought A LOT of water, a lot of sandwiches and energybars, mainly to keep the young guy happy, and set off up the trail towards the waterfalls. The hike just keeps getting more and more beautiful. The Misty Trail takes you right passed Vernal Falls. Yes, the steps are heavy going, but anyone in average shape can do it. (Starting early is very important - those steps in the heat of day would be a lot harder.) The views are staggering, and from there it just gets better. The next waterfall is Nevada Fall. Again, breathtakingly beautiful. Our camera was on the verge of overheating. After Nevada Falls it gets a bit more heavy going. Walking through Little Yosemite Valley, and on (up up up up up) to the sub dome is hard work, but never boring. We saw several dear, and just enjoyed the beautiful nature. Getting up the sub dome was nowhere near as hard or scary as we had been led to believe. If you have a bad fear of hights, this is probably where the journey ends, but it's really not that bad once you get started. The views from the sub dome are fantastic, so even if one doesn't do the cables, just getting to the subdome is worth the effort!And then The Famous Cables, getting up the last bit of Half Dome. Awesome! (Yes, we did bring gloves). It is hard work, but anyone in normal shape can do it. It's psychologically challenging, but physically You can do it ;-) We enjoyed the views, and felt very \"on top of things\".Getting back was tiring for our son, but he managed just fine. We saw two bears on the way back - one right by Emerald Pool. We decided to go back down Misty Trail - it's shorter but harder. Again, sublime views! We spent a LONG time getting back, stopping for almost an hour to feel the cool water in Emerald Pool, and just to take as many pics as possible.At the end of the hike we were all feeling very tired, and absolutely GREAT! Again, if you're in ok shape this hike is no problem - but you will be tired at the end!) If you're in doubt - just do it! It's worth the effort!\n",

      "Review:  Yosemite Falls is an amazing sight, but the best way to see it was from the hike (especially in the Spring!)! Just hiking near it and seeing both lower and upper falls, hearing all that water crash, and seeing all the water shoot off the edge at the top is an amazing display of nature and nature's power. I actually enjoyed this hike more than the Half Dome hike (although also a great hike!).\n",
      "Review:  It is one of the prettiest places in the park. We got there for sunrise. Animals were all over the place and seemed to want their pictures taken. It was the only place in the park in September where water falls were to be seen (Glacier Point Basin Area). We spent an hour there enjoying the scenery. It is handicapped accessible with clean flush toilet facilities.\n",
      "Review:  The lower falls trail is ridiculously packed during the day so I'd recommend going first thing in the morning (like 7 am) and then grabbing breakfast afterwards. It's much more enjoyable without a bunch of people and screaming children running around. It's an easy, paved walk so it is accessible for all fitness levels and disabled individuals. I've seen people take wheelchairs and strollers to the lower falls with no problems (although it can be a little steep depending on which direction you're coming from).The upper falls trail is tough. Don't underestimate how difficult it is, especially if you're not used to this altitude. I saw people in tennis shoes slipping on the granite rocks and heard them complain about rolling their ankles. Wear hiking shoes. Also, 1 liter of water will not be enough to get you to the top! I saw people dragging small children up the trail with skirts and sandals on and a 16 oz bottle of water, don't be that parent. Also, the trail has direct sunlight in parts so wear/bring sunscreen or a hat if you burn easily. Also pack your lunch and bring it with you, you'll need the energy. It's a beautiful trail with amazing views of the valley from the lookout at the top and there's great places to sit and have lunch if you head towards the Yosemite Point trail and sit along the water. When in doubt, stop by the Visitor Center and ask a ranger any questions you have about a trail BEFORE going on that trail. They're happy to help. \n",

      "Review:  Date of Hike: Tue, Aug 3rd 2010, Start time: 06:00 AM, End Time: 12:40 PMDuration: 6:40 hrs (3:35 hrs to go up, 40 mins at the top, 2:25 to come down)Length of Hike: 15.4 mi RT (from trailhead parking lot). 14.4 mi RT (from Happy Isles Trailhead)We were staying in Yosemite West. So i drove at about 5:30 AM to Yosemite Valley. The trailhead parking lot was full at 6AM, but i still managed to find a spot. If you don't find a spot, you need to park in Curry Village (add 0.5 mi RT to your hike).Started the hike at 6AM sharp. The hike was pretty busy and i could see a lot of people in front of me (all of them were going to Half Dome as it was too early for any other Mist Trail Hikes). With the permit system in place on Fri/Sat/Sun, the balance of crowd has shifted to weekdays. It wasn't too bad though because i overtook most of them in about 1 hr.In 10 mins i was at the Happy Isles Trailhead. Then you climb on a paved walkway until about 0.8 mi (all distances mentioned from Happy Isles Trailhead). This is where you cross the footbridge and get a glimpse of the Vernal falls (which had a surprising amount of water for August). If you want to just visit Vernal Falls, i would suggest climbing a few hunderd feet where you get a much better view. I was at the footbridge 25 mins into the trek (from the parking lot). This is also the place where the John Muir Trail (a longer one) bifurcates.Just after the footbridge you have restrooms and the last place you can fill water (unless you are carrying a filter). After crossing the footbridge, the trail continues climbing for the next 10 mins or so. The views of the falls get better and better. Then you hit the stairs. About 50 steps take you to a viewing platform for the Vernal Falls. You then continue on the steps to the top of the Vernal falls. This section is tiring as the steps are tall and a lot of them. You see the falls from several different angles as you climb the steps. I was at the top of Vernal Falls in 52 mins (1.5 mi from trailhead and 2 mi from parking lot). At the top of Vernal Falls, there is a pool of water called Emerald Pool. You can wet your feet in there if you want, but swimming isn't allowed for obvious reasons. After a few snaps, i was off climbing up. The trail now becomes rocky at places and if not for the crowd would've been difficult to find a couple of places. It continues climbing moderately until you see Nevada falls. Nevada falls is huge (higher than Vernal falls). After this point the trail climbs up in stairs. These stairs aren't as well defined as the Vernal Falls stairs. You climb all the way to the top of the Nevada falls where you find restrooms. These have photovoltic cells which supposedly breakdown the waste. I was here in 1:25 hr (2.7 mi from trailhead, 3.2 mi from parking lot). This is the place where the John Muir trail rejoins the Mist Trail. After a quick break, i continued on. The trail now gets dusty and also climbs for the next 10-15 minutes. After that point the trail becomes level for the next mile or so. This section is also sandy, so it slows you down. You also hit Little Yosemite Valley and Campground to your right. This is nice breather after all the climbing you have done. You will also notice the heat of the sun at this point if you started early morning on a summer day. Soon enough you hit the forest again and the trail starts climbing again through some lovely forests. I reached the marker that said 2 miles to go in about 2:20 hr (from the parking lot). After a short break and a bite to eat, the climb continued thru the forests until you reach a clearing on top of a granite hill. There are good views of the surrounding mountains from here. Another few steps and you see people sticking to the subdome at angles which i thought were impossible. I thought that they were on cables. A few minutes later i realized that they were climbing that steep slope of the subdome. Soon enough i was also there at the base of the subdome. To me the subdome climb was by far the toughest of the trek. It was hot by that time, there was not much shade, it was late in the trek, we were at an altitude of 7000+ ft and it was very steep. This hike is on granite steps built into the subdome. One tip - Do not look up too much and psych yourself out. It was easier when you were focussing on the immediate steps or switchback. Slowly but surely i climbed up the subdome. Took about 35 mins to climb the subdome. Once on the top of the subdome, you know that you are going to make the top of the Half Dome. The views from here are pretty good. It is a flattish sort of top where you can relax, watch others tackle the cable and get ready to do the same. I didn't bring any gloves, but there were plenty of spare gloves just before the cables. After taking a few snaps i picked up a pair of gloves and started up the cables. Boy, do you need upper body strengh on the cables. You have to pull your whole body weight on the cables. There are wooden planks every 10-15 ft and the aim is to pull yourself from one set of planks to the next. You can relax a bit on planks and relax your arms a bit. There were a couple of planks missing so one had to pull for longer in those sections. Some sections were really steep so you were actually doing rock climbing. After about 20 mins of cables and about 50 sets of wooden planks, I was at the top. The view from the top was amazing. The valley below, the surrounding mountains, everything. I took several snaps. Somebody took my snap of standing on that famous hanging rock. After a long rest and bite to eat, it was time to go down. The cables going down was a breeze. Face towards the rock when going down also. This time the crucial thing is never let go of the cables as you are sliding down from plank to plank. The climb down the subdome was easy too, a bit tricky as it was slippery on the gravel laden granite steps.Once at the base of the subdome, the walk down all the way to the Nevada falls was a breeze. Then there was the walk down the steps from Nevada falls to Vernal falls and more steps to the footbridge. One just has to be careful on these steps. It isn't particularly tiring though. The last 20 mins were spent walking briskly from the footbridge to the parking lot.I was wearing this Superman T-shirt and there were a lot of comments on why i didn't fly to Half Dome:)My answer always was that i was saving on gas :)On the way down, i saw hordes of people trekking up to Half Dome. It sure is a crowded place. I suggest you start early (5:30 AM would be perfect). The trail before Vernal falls gets especially crowded with all the people who trek only to Vernal falls footbridge.Note: The marker initially says that the distance to the half dome is 8.4 miles, but that is via the longer John Muir Trail. It is 7.2 miles via the Mist Trail. This was a varied hike with waterfalls, forests and domes and cables. I would surely recommend it to anyone. All in all, it was tough but not terribly so. I had plenty left in the tank after the hike (and did hike a few miles in the evening). I would rate this behind the South Kaibab trail and back trek i did on a June day in Grand Canyon. And it would pale in comparison to the few high altitude treks of the Himalayas i've done.Most websites say that this hike is 10-14 hours. I would say that for a person in good physical shape, the hike should not take more than 8 hours RT. For a person in reasonable shape, it would still be less than 10 hours. If you take a lot of breaks  it may take longer.Cheers\n",
      "Review:  Probably the most popular (lots of people on trail) of the strenuous hikes in Yosemite Valley. The reward is spectacular scenery, including but not limited to Vernal Falls. It is pretty right from the start with the Merced River on your right as you begin the hike. Several large boulders line the trail on the early part. The trail surface for the first 0.8 mile is paved but fairly steep. Anyone should be able to navigate this section though you may need a few rest stops. It is steep and combined with the elevation it will get your heart pumping. After 0.8 mile you will be at Vernal Fall Bridge which has a great view of Vernal in the distance. There is drinkable water and restrooms at this point.The next section of the trail leads up to the top of Vernal Fall, about 0.7 mile further. The Merced River is on your left as it crashes over boulders. Vernal will be ahead of you and if you are lucky a rainbow will be rising from the mist of the falls. This section of the trail is like climbing up a long set of stairs. The trail is either paved or well cut stone steps. The challenges here are that the trail surface is wet from mist and the climb is steep and continuous. There are stair railings along the more exposed portions of the trail. Again, anyone who can climb stairs can do this section but it can be slippery and will get your heart pumping.At the top you will come out right at the edge of Vernal Fall with a great view down the river. After you take a few photos, there are flat, shady areas where you can sit and rest. There are also restrooms at the top of Vernal Fall. Walk a little further up the trail as if you are going up to Nevada Fall and you will see Emerald Pool and the Silver Apron, both worth seeing.Beyond this point is the trail up to Nevada Fall. The trail surface changes here and is no longer paved. The climb to Nevada Fall has fewer people but is also rougher. A great view awaits if you climb to top of Nevada Fall but if you decide to end your hike at Vernal you will still have seen beautiful sights.\n",
      "Review:  those cables going up to the dome are extremely slippy worst without gloves the surface is also slippy even with new trail shoes. i reccommend going up only with water and leaving backpack below with buddie and take turns going to top. i pulled out two poles on the way up they are not in the holes much maybe 10 inches. managed to put poles back in hole fairly easy. view on top much overated almost as good on tough saddle dome formally quarter dome just before climb up cables. went on july 24 hit cables about 2pm immediately no line but quite hot was about 15 people going up and down.   very tough cable climb gets much less tough last 30 ft. didnt spend much time on top because buddie was baking in sun drinking h20. was up and down cables in 1hr.  buddie had heard someone left backpac unattended and squirrel chewed hole through it..       rest of hike great  . no need to go any farther than beautiful spacious shady area before approach to saddle dome/quarter dome great place for a siesta late lunch    both waterfalls excellent did the same way up and down seen 1 small bear about 1pm. on the way back down the mist trail was getting close to dusk a few young people running with a empty water bottle. they were only about 10 min to the vernal footbridge water fountain. apparently a party of 5 males had a injury and we seen a ranger running down the path to happy isle.\n",
      "Review:  This hike has it all - the river, the waterfalls, the granite walls, the forest, the panoramic views, the freaky cables, and the nice finish.  You could split the hike (via Mist Trail) into many different sections - 1st bridge (1mi), Mist Trail to top of Vernal Falls (0.7mi), top of Nevada Falls (1.4mi), Little Yosemite (1mi), to Half Dome Trail (2.1mi), Half Dome (2.0mi).  Everything up to Yosemite valley is so incredibly beautiful with the river that you forget you're climbing to Half Dome.  Climbing the Mist trail, Nevada Falls, sub-dome, and the cables are the steepest parts, but the rest isn't too bad.  I happened to be training for a marathon and my goal was to not get hurt.  It ended up being an excellent cross-training, but I probably had a nice advantage.Shoes - Saw all kinds of shoes on the trail from sandals to backpacking boots.  I wore an old pair of road running shoes and they worked great.  I wouldn't have worn boots.  They're overkill and probably won't provide the flexible traction you need in some areas.  Trail running shoes are probably optimal.Half Dome Cables - Need a permit.  Sometimes you can find people with extra permits on the trail.  I know we saw people without permits that went ahead of us to try their luck, somehow they got made it past the ranger (beginning of subdome).  Everyone says to bring gloves, but specifically, the sticky rubbery ones on the bottom.  The cables are super smooth, so you need that traction.  I had smooth gloves and I had to work that much harder to keep a grip.I'm have a fear of heights and got very worried leading up to the cables.  They're like an 'S' curve with gradual beginning, sharp incline in the middle before easing off at the top.  It was easier than it looked.  Once you start, just keep moving.  Don't stop to look around and think about where you're at - just get it over with.  On the way down, some faced forward and some went down backwards.  I started forward and just kept going that way by just tucking the cable under my armpit, grabbing both sides, and walking down to the next board.  It was way faster than trying to back down.Note - I tried climbing up with those carabiners clipped to the cables for safety, but this is very difficult going up, because it's very hard to reach back after you make it to the next board to unclip and clip back on to the next section.  Very awkward.Once you're at the top, the view are great, but you're obviously missing the best view of the valley (half dome), because you happened to be standing on it.Our group lolligagged so much getting to the top (7 hours) and I needed to drive home that day, so I flew down the mountain by myself in about 2.5 to 2.75 hours.  I didn't stop for anything even refueling on the move.There were kids as young as 8 on the cables (crying with a death grip on his Dad on the way down, but I'm glad I didn't take my 11 yo son.  It's definitely possible, but I think 12-13 is probably a good age for most.Another Note - There is a small backtrack if you want to see the top of Nevada Falls once you get to the top of the Mist Trail.  There is a restroom there, while the last restroom is in Little Yosemite Valley.Hope this helps.  Enjoy!!!\n",
      "Review:  Check this off the bucket list!!! My wife a I started out at 6am on our way up the Mist Trail. The hike is both easy and hard to put into words. The sights and sounds of nature drive you upward on this hike. I am from Alabama and we don't have any hills to prepare you for this, but I felt unstoppable. I planned and trained very carefully for this and it went off without a hitch. It is almost a week later and I am still in awe of this accomplishment. We took a break every so often and had snacks to keep our energy up. Sub Dome was the scariest part to me and I wondered how I was going to get down coming back. It ended up being easier than expected. We stopped there before going up the cables. I strongly suggest strengthening your upper body before you attempt this. WEAR GLOVES!!! The nitrile coated ones from the hardware store work fine. I still had blisters and tore a callus off my right hand due to the death grip you have to keep on the cables. The view from the top is spectacular, but there are better views in the park. It wasn't about that. Going down the cables was easy but took longer due to traffic. We went back down the JMT to save our knees, but they were still destroyed, Thank God we used trekking poles-they are a must also. It took us 13 hours total and I drank a gallon of water and I drank conservatively. I could have drank 2 gallons easily, I had a filter just in case. Our legs were dead and we were starving, but it was worth every step and I would do again tomorrow. People in California are so blessed to have such natural wonders. Now go climb a rock!!!\n",

      "Review:  The Yosemite Valley is the heart of Yosemite National Park. It is a lovely area to spend a few days exploring some of the most beautiful outdoors in the States. There are numerous easy, moderate and more challenging hikes throughout the valley. Additionally, visitors will see incredible waterfalls, including Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls as well as the beautiful Merced Rivers which flows through the valley. Other impressive land formations include El Capitan and Half Dome in the distance, these are granite monolith formations, beautifully carved by glacier activity over a million years ago. Within the valley, you will find early 20th century buildings and historic bridges described as National Park Rustic style. They are beautifully set within the environs of the valley. There is village within the valley where you will find the National Park Visitor Centre, educational buildings, Ansel Adams studio, the Village Store and eateries. There are a variety of accommodation options within the valley as well.  Lastly, due to traffic, visitors are encouraged to use the free shuttle buses to help elevate crowded road conditions. We found this useful during our 3 day visit last month. There are shuttle stops at numerous popular places within the valley including the large open carpark not far from the Village Store.\n",
      "Review:  As part of my day tour from SFO,  the tour operator stopped here. The rock formation is gigantic. I believe a lot of rock climbers come and camp here. I walked close to the rock and came back. Saw a herd of deer grazing there. I am not sure how one could climb this. the tour operator told us that the first climb took some 45 days. (not sure how one would eat, sleep and pee while climbing for 45 days). the record is 2.5 hours it seems. I am not sure if there are trails to go to the top of the rock. Must be fascinating for rock climbers.\n",
      "Review:  I have never heard of Yosemite National Park before until my godmother told me about it and brought me there when I visited her last August. The road was long and winding from San Francisco to Yosemite but it was all worth it. This was my very first visit to a national park in the US and I never imagined it could be that magnificent. I was truly astonished by the beauty of the rock formations, the lush meadow and the serenity of the park. Standing tall among the rock formations is El Capitan which is located on the northern side of the Yosemite valley. It was a breath-taking massive granite monolith! I was told that it is one of the most challenging sites for mountain climbers and I can't imagine how one can go to its top considering its height. Definitely not one of my dreams to reach its top... I was more than happy to just have the chance to watch it from afar and to have taken some photos although the photos do not really give this wonder justice.\n",
      "Review:  There's a reason this is the image so closely associated with Yosemite. It is a breathtaking monolith. It towers over the valley and is incredible. The granite icon can be viewed from many of the most popular tourist spots. While viewing it with the naked eye is a treat, binoculars add a special experience. On most days you can see climbers making their way up the sheer face. It's pretty amazing to look through the binoculars in early morning and watch the climbers emerge from their sleeping bags or tents while dangling halfway up.\n",
      "Review:  El Capitan is known worldwide as vertical granite rock formation that is challenging for rock climbers everywhere. It is also a true highlight at Yosemite National Park. It can take five days or more to get to the peak or just minutes to enjoy it from a safe distance.\n",

The mountains are lined up beautifully. This makes for amazing photos. HOWEVER- The early morning is NOT the time to go. We were actually disappointed. Sun is behind us. Mountains appeared \"hazy\". You really must wait until later in the day. The issue is that we did not want to move our car once we had a great parking spot in the Valley so we drove to Tunnel View (then Glacier Point) just after checking out. We should have gone later  in the day. Next time!\n",
      "Review:  Most people that go to Yosemite National Park are going to end up in Yosemite Valley and for good reason.  The place is stunningly beautiful.  The views from Tunnel View, Valley View and around Yosemite Falls and Half Dome are amazing.  We stayed in the Valley for 3 nights at Yosemite Valley Lodge and it was the perfect base of operations.  Yosemite Falls is right behind the hotel, the Valley Floor Trail passes right by and most of the valley is just a handful of bus stops away.  The bus system worked well for us, except in the heart of the day, which caused full buses that would skip stops if nobody was getting off.  Walking is a great option though as there are sites everywhere, including the occasional bear sighting.We hiked part of the Valley Floor Trail.  We took the purple bus line to El Capitan and hiked right to the foot of it and enjoyed the views from the meadow.  We hiked the Mist Trail along with everyone else in the valley, or so it seemed!  We took an excellent Valley Floor Tour.  We also did the short trail to Lower Yosemite Falls.It is a very busy place and the traffic can be bad.  We were there during weekdays in June, but I was told the summer weekends get crazy.  Everyone will tell you to get into the valley as early as you can.  We did the opposite though.  We came in from the east down Tioga Road and stopped at all the big sights.  We entered the valley around 8:15 PM and there was no traffic.  Just a handful of cars.  We stopped for some excellent late afternoon views and checked in at around 9:30 PM.  It was simple and there was plenty of parking at Yosemite Valley Lodge.  We left the park 4 days later at 8:00 am and the drive out was just as easy.\n",

      "Review:  Oh gosh where do I start. I am a late forties unfit reluctant hiker whose husband loves these hikes. So this was always going to be an incredible challenge for me. We went up the mist trail which is, as the yosemite newsletter says 'extremely strenuous'. I did however manage it with plenty of stops. I am not great with heights but only struggled in a couple of places where the stone steps were particularly close to a big drop. There are hundreds of steps in the rock so very tiring. When we reached Nevada falls I was disheartened to realise we had only gone 2.5 miles - this had took hours but because of the large altitude gain we had not covered much mileage. But I struggled on despite knowing half dome was still 4.5 miles away. I managed approx 2 more miles before admitting defeat. I turned around and my husband continued on. I was able to sit and wait at Nevada falls enjoying the great views.We chose to return via the John Muir trail as the thought of the sharp descend via the mist trail was not for us. Before attempting this it was great to be able to soak tired feet in the river.The trail on the return is longer than the mist trail at 4 miles but easier as if is less vertical!So I managed around 10 strenuous miles but did not conquer half dome!There are some stunning views particularly of Nevada falls on the return trail. It is well worth attempting for wonderful views the whole time\n",
      "Review:  Best hike in Yosemite! Start early (5 to 6 am). Park in the backpackers parking lot. It was a 12 hour round trip from the car for our group. The cables at the top are manageable but not for the faint of heart. The view from the top is absolutely spectacular. You must have a permit as a Park Ranger was checking everyone. The most likely way to get a permit through the lottery id to apply before the season opens and select multiple different days as options. If it's your 1st time, I recommend hiking from the Valley floor because the waterfalls along the way are not to be missed. Otherwise, the hike from Glacier Point might be better as it's less crowded and starts at a higher elevation. Enjoy!\n",
      "Review:  We started around 6:30 am from the Happy Isle trailhead.  We headed up the vernal falls path and then on to the Nevada Fall. Much of this trail is narrow, steep and full of uneven stone steps. In my opinion the views are worth it. That said it isn't for the faint of heart. You should be in good shape and acclimated to the base altitude of 4000 feet. Take plenty of water and sunscreen. Wear  layers. You need a permit to hike sub dome and summit half dome on the cables. The safest way to obtain a permit is in the spring. But it is date specific. There is also a lottery 2 days before the date you want to summit.  In peak tourist season your odds of obtaining a permit 2 days prior probably aren't favorable. But we did the hike in mid September and had no problem.  \n",
      "Review:  The climb from the Yosemite Valley floor to the top of Hal Dome is about 9 miles with an elevation gain of about 4,500 feet.  It is a strenuous hike.  Plan on a full day to accomplish the climb, at least 12 hours.  The hike up and past Vernal and Nevada is spectacular, but once you start the climb up the approach to half dome it just seems to go on and on.  Finally you arrive at the base of the rock.  This final part of the climb is not for the faint of heart and people have been know to fall from this section. Don't waste all your time and energy getting to this point just to freak out on this section.  The sense of accomplishment upon reaching the top is gratifying, but then you have 9 miles of down hill back to the valley floor.\n",
      "Review:  This is a tough but doable hike for most people and takes roughly 3 hours roundtrip. We hiked up the Mist Trail and then down via the John Muir Trail which was lovely! (Due to the crowds, we thought it might be safer to try the JM trail but it takes longer.)In the morning, allow time to get to shuttle stop 16/Happy Isles (took us a good 40 mins from one of the main parking lots in mid-June) and time to drive into the valley if staying outside the park. Shuttle stop 16 is where everyone gets off. It's like a stop outside Disneyland. By 11am in summer, the trail is crowded.Plan to get there early if you don't want to join the masses. It's the sheer number of people going up and down that narrow, misty part of the path (many in inappropriate footwear) that seems to present the greatest danger (like the middle-age man who angrily pushed past people as if he were in the final leg of the Amazing Race). If you can't get there early, please be respectful of others. This park and this path belongs to us all. It is absolutely not a race to the top.If you plan to hike farther than the footbridge, plan on taking at least 2L of water (hydropacks make this easy & you can refill at the footbridge water station) and some snacks.It's seems just prudent to wear sturdy shoes with good tread. However... there are plenty of folks in footwear better suited for a walk at the mall. I saw kids in flip flops, older ladies in sandals with zero support and two people in Crocs. Yes, summertime means sandals and the like but this is a tough hike over uneven, slippery terrain. I could see myself twisting an ankle where the path gets rocky and I just didn't want to have to be airlifted out. Be smart and wear sturdy shoes (sturdy sneakers, trail shoes, hiking books)! Check your tread, make sure it's not been worn smooth like slippers before you go.Yes, yes, yes, many an ordinary out-of-shape person has made it to the top of Vernal Falls and even to Nevada Falls and back wearing flip flops (and carrying just one 8 oz bottle of water) but I think they were just lucky. This is not the flat paved path of your local city park! Be smart. Don't win a Darwin award.I saw a very capable, fit looking parent in hiking boots with a baby in a carrier on his back. But I also saw a parent nervously taking one unsure step after another while clutching a baby in a moby wrap.And don't swim or wade in the Merced River or swim in the Emerald Pool, enticing as it might be. Don't go off path just to splash some cool river water on your hot and sweaty faces, especially if you're wearing crappy shoes. That granite you're perched upon at the water's edge is slippery and the current can be strong. The Emerald Pool is not far from the 300 foot drop of Vernal Falls, you know? Again, don't win a Darwin award.Be smart in your footwear choices, carry water and be respectful of other people and the park rules and you will have an amazing time hiking this treasure of a trail.\n",
