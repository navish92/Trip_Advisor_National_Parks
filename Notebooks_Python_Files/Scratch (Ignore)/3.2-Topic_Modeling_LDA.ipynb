It is a beautiful land formation with a surface smooth, the result of glacier activity nearly 1.3 million years ago. You won't be able to help but see El Capitan throughout your time in the Valley. It is first encountered as you drive through the Yosemite Tunnel and stop at the tunnel viewpoint. El Capitan dominates the landscape to the left, just opposite the Bridalveil Falls to the right of your view at this location. While driving in the valley, you can pull over from Northside Drive at the El Capitan Meadow and with binoculars, you can spot rock climbers scaling El Capitan. Simply look in the crevices and you'll seem them, tiny specks of colour upon the rock face. The sun shines nicely against El Capitan from late morning onward, allowing nice photographs to be taken during much of the day. When skies are clear and blue, it is a wonderful land formation to see as part of your Yosemite National Park experience.\"\n",

      "[\"Here is the most important thing to know about all the falls in Yosemite Park.  I have seen a number of people complaining in reviews that they were here in summer, fall, winter, whatever, and the falls were anemic. In California, it does not rain from late spring through mid-fall, and there is no water. The spectacular falls rely on spring snow melt, and so are at their best in early to mid spring.  Even in winter, when it begins to rain, rainfall alone is not enough to really get the falls going, it is when the snowpack melts that they thunder and roar.  So if it is your goal to see the falls at their best, it is essential you plan a spring trip.Yosemite Falls is one spectacular fall.  Well, actually, it is a 3fer! While it is not wide, it is reportedly the tallest waterfall in the U.S.  The upper fall plunges straight down from where Yosemite Creek pours over the edge on its way to join the Merced River.  It is the tallest and most dramatic section of the falls, foaming and frothing on its way down.  The falls then tumble through a series of cascades that are hard to see from most vantage points, before lunching themselves into the final, narrow dive of the lower falls.  At the bottom of the lower falls is an excellent area to view the lower falls fairly up close; further back along the trail leading to the bottom are great views of both upper and lower falls.  Expect to get a little damp from the spray at the bottom of the falls, especially if it's a breezy day. If the falls are in full roar, you will be able to feel the thunder in your chest.\"\n",
      " 'It is best to see these falls from Glacier Point.  They can be viewed from Yosemite Valley but I could only see on fall.'\n",
      " \"Often by August the falls are dry so see the falls earlier in the tear if possible>  If you're in the valley it's hard not to see the falls\"\n",
      " \"Again, you can see Yosemite Falls all over the Valley. Your eye is drawn to them all the time - I'd compare the falls with Trummelbach Falls in the Wengen/Lauterbrunnen valley in Switzerland.\"\n",
      " 'This is also a must do trail to get closer to the falls and see more of the Valley. The view of the falls is worth the trip.']\n"

      "['I have been through this Trail twice.  First time was in June 2008 on the way to Half Dome and as the fall was in full blast, it was not a \"mist\" trail, it was more like a \"freaking thunderstorming turning over a bucket\" trail.  This time around I came down the mist trail on the Panorama Trail and as it was August, I barely got misted.  This is a pretty spectacular trail and a relatively short hike from Happy Isles (2 miles to the top or Vernal Fall or something like that).  It\\'s worth a hike up to the top, but use the mist trail, not the John Muir trail.  '\n",
      " \"The mist trail is a very strenuous hike but worth it.  If you don't think you can do it, then there's always the John Muir trail to the top of Nevada Falls.  The John Muir trail is easier but still pretty difficult.  We hiked to the top of the Nevada Falls via the Mist trail but hiked back down via the John Muir trail.\"\n",
      " 'Do not sleep in.  We were on the Mist Trail by 7:30 a.m.  We also walked up to Nevada Fall and came back down the John Muir Trail.  There were not crowds until about 11:00 a.m.'\n",
      " 'We went up the Mist trail all the way to the top .... W o W !'\n",
      " \"We visited Yosemite for four days and had entered the lottery to climb Half Dome. I was pretty disappointed when we didn't get it, but what ya gonna do? We wanted to do a long hike and decided on the Mist Trail to the Panorama Trail to Glacier Point, and then back down to the valley via Four Mile Trail. Mist Trail was AWESOME! And the mist is no joke...you get soaked! We had raincoats, and I was glad we did to protect my camera. Besides the amazing experience of climbing up (a lot of the trail is steep stairs) through the mist and seeing the beautiful Vernal and Nevada Falls, there were rainbows in the canyon, so close that if they had been tangible, we could have touched them. It was truly magical. While we went on to the Panorama and Four Mile trail, which was almost 14 miles, if you just do the Mist Trail and want to come back down, I would recommend descending on the John Muir Trail, which is to the right of the Mist Trail. The Mist Trail is very steep and slippery and I would imagine difficult to descend. IMO, this is one hike not to be missed!\"]\n"

It is a but longer of a hike to Sentinel Dome from the Taft Point trail head than from Glacier point but supposedly not as steep.

      "[\"Here is the most important thing to know about all the falls in Yosemite Park.  I have seen a number of people complaining in reviews that they were here in summer, fall, winter, whatever, and the falls were anemic. In California, it does not rain from late spring through mid-fall, and there is no water. The spectacular falls rely on spring snow melt, and so are at their best in early to mid spring.  Even in winter, when it begins to rain, rainfall alone is not enough to really get the falls going, it is when the snowpack melts that they thunder and roar.  So if it is your goal to see the falls at their best, it is essential you plan a spring trip.Yosemite Falls is one spectacular fall.  Well, actually, it is a 3fer! While it is not wide, it is reportedly the tallest waterfall in the U.S.  The upper fall plunges straight down from where Yosemite Creek pours over the edge on its way to join the Merced River.  It is the tallest and most dramatic section of the falls, foaming and frothing on its way down.  The falls then tumble through a series of cascades that are hard to see from most vantage points, before lunching themselves into the final, narrow dive of the lower falls.  At the bottom of the lower falls is an excellent area to view the lower falls fairly up close; further back along the trail leading to the bottom are great views of both upper and lower falls.  Expect to get a little damp from the spray at the bottom of the falls, especially if it's a breezy day. If the falls are in full roar, you will be able to feel the thunder in your chest.\"\n",
      " 'The lower fall is spectacular and if we had enough time we would have walked to the top to see the upper fall.'\n",
      " 'Easy trail to the bottom of the Lower Falls. From that point you can see Upper and Lower Falls together. Amazing.'\n",
      " 'Take the short trail to the base of the falls.  From here you can see just the lower falls.  Walk out on Cooks Meadow, or go to Swinging bridge and see both upper and lower falls, but from farther away'\n",
      " 'Since the Yosemite Falls are some of the longest in the world, they are a must-see.  The trail to get to the Lower part of the falls is an easy hike, but to get a view of the whole Upper and Lower Falls, you only need to go to a place near the restrooms (which, by the way, are pretty nice flushies).  So if a hike is out of the question, you can still see the falls.  We went in the spring when the falls were roaring . . . we loved it']\n"

      "[\"Tioga Pass is a small pass between the mountains on your way to enter the Yosemite Valley through the Tioga road from East. However; I presume most people tend to equate it with the entire Tioga road - which is an excellent 2 hour scenic drive through not so scary mountain roads, meadows and lakes from the town of Lee Vining to Yosemite Village. You come across several Yosemite attractions along the way (Tioga Lake, Tenaya Lake, Lembert Dome, Dog Lake, Tolumne meadows to name a few). Check the road condition before you travel; as it can be closed during snow (there's a sign on highway 395 that let's you know if the pass is open or closed). Amenities along the road are not available in winter; but in summer when the road is open you can get several eateries; the west entrance visitor center and a gas station. The road can be narrow at times; so drive carefully and enjoy the scenery.\"\n",
      " \"The drive along Tioga Road and over Tioga Pass is is one of California's most spectacular. The scenery along the way is amazing - Tenaya Lake, Tuolumne Meadows, views of Mt. Hoffmann, Mt. Conness, Mt. Dana, and the Cathedral Range, and the view from Olmstead Point of Half Dome and Clouds Rest from a much different vantage point than from Yosemite Valley. And the drive up (or especially down) the east side of Tioga Pass to Lee Vining and Mono Lake is exhilarating...although those with a fear of heights might want to think twice about that portion of the road. There's a pullout on the east side of the pass that offers a great view down Lee Vining Canyon and far beyond to the White Mountains on a clear day. Lots of options for things to do right around Tioga Pass itself - the meadows around there are beautiful, you can hike to the top of Mt. Dana, Gaylor Peak, or Tioga Peak, drive up to Saddlebag Lake and hike the 20 Lakes Basin, fish at one of the lakes near the pass, etc. So many people don't see Yosemite from anywhere other than the Valley, and maybe Glacier Point, but there is so much more to see in the high country along the Tioga Road.\"\n",
      " 'The Tioga Pass road is a mountain pass in the Sierra Nevada Mountains that allows you to drive directly to Yosemite Valley from the eastern side of the mountains (without taking a huge detour around the mountains).  The road to Yosemite Valley starts in Lee Vining, California. The Tioga Pass Road takes about two hours to drive and generally closes due to bad weather around November and re-opens in May or June.I drove through the pass in late July with my wife as we were leaving Yosemite on our way to Lake Tahoe. We both enjoyed this amazing drive and stopped several times to get a better view and take some pictures. The road passes by many great alpine lakes including Tiago and Ellery and the road also passes through Tuolumne Meadows, one of Yosemite’s most famous attractions.  There are a few spots on the road that made my wife nervous as we were near the edge of a cliff at times.  I thought the drive would have been a little more nerve wracking based on some of the reviews I read before the trip started.Overall I really enjoyed this amazing drive and recommend it. Take your time to get the most out of the drive. I would not like to drive this in the winter (even though I am from Minnesota and used to driving in snow). I thought Tioga Pass was one of the most scenic drives I have ever been on.'\n",
      " 'We were fortunate in being able to unexpectedly drive along the Tioga Pass Road at Christmas when we visited YNP. Usually the road is closed in the winter, but the bizarre weather had left Yosemite strangely snowless in December, so the whole of the park, including this road, was open. It was simply amazing to drive along. If it\\'s open when you visit, please don\\'t pass up on the opportunity to see it. The scenery seems to change with every turn of the road, and you\\'ll go from alpine vistas to granite slabs to almost desert scenery along the way. And if you head out east of the Tioga Pass itself and have time, I\\'d recommend a visit to Mono Lake in Lee Vining - you have to see the spectacular \"tufa towers\" on the town\\'s Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve  - calcium carbonate spires and knobs formed by interaction of freshwater springs and alkaline lake water.

      " 'El Capitan is a high mountain with a sheer cliff face that is very popular with rock climbers. The valley roads and the Tunnel View give excellent views of El Capitan.'\n",
      " 'El Capitan is a granite rock formation in Yosemite national park vertically. It is about 3000 ft high from its base to the top. El Capitan, also known as El Cap is located on the north side of Yosemite Valley, near its western end. It is very popular for rock climbers.The top of El Capitan can be reached by hiking out of Yosemite Valley on the trail next to Yosemite Falls but for climbers, the challenge is to climb up the sheer granite face. There are many named climbing routes, all of them arduous, including Iron Hawk and Sea of Dreams. In the early days of climbing, it used to take many days but recently many solo climbers have clocked it in few hours. '\n",
      " \"There is a beach at the base of El Capitan, called Devil's Elbow. It's the perfect place to get an up close view of the grandeur and size of El Capitan. Bring binoculars as you may have the pleasure of seeing climbers on the face.\"\n",
      " \"El Capitan is a granite monolith that juts upward 3,000 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor. It is a beautiful land formation with a surface smooth, the result of glacier activity nearly 1.3 million years ago. You won't be able to help but see El Capitan throughout your time in the Valley. It is first encountered as you drive through the Yosemite Tunnel and stop at the tunnel viewpoint. El Capitan dominates the landscape to the left, just opposite the Bridalveil Falls to the right of your view at this location. While driving in the valley, you can pull over from Northside Drive at the El Capitan Meadow and with binoculars, you can spot rock climbers scaling El Capitan. Simply look in the crevices and you'll seem them, tiny specks of colour upon the rock face. The sun shines nicely against El Capitan from late morning onward, allowing nice photographs to be taken during much of the day. When skies are clear and blue, it is a wonderful land formation to see as part of your Yosemite National Park experience.\"]\n"

      "['This bus “tour” was not a tour. If you’re traveling from out of town/state with a car rental, please do yourself a favor and save your money - Make the drive up to Glacier Point yourself! The bus “tour” was literally just a bus ride up!! Our driver was friendly and the tour “kind of” started out as a tour but all he was mentioning was the vegetation growing on the side of the road in the beginning. We also learned that a tunnel was made by men in the depression era looking to earn money for their families. That’s it. That’s all we learned, then slept the rest of the hour-plus drive up! Finally made it up and we’re given an hour to use the restroom, view, walk around, and get a snack. Since we booked the round-trip “tour” we felt this was rushed. We really began regretting not using our rental car for this experience which would have saved my family of 4 $216! The Glacier views are absolutely amazing and SO worth the trip up (on your own)! Literally a MUST SEE!!! However. The drive back was even worse. All the bus driver did was laugh and talk with the veterans that were sitting up by him, swapping stories, the whole way back....! Not one mention of the Park. I’m glad I paid for the gas to get us up there and back in a bus I guess. Unfortunately, we were not impressed by the silly tour that literally put us to sleep. It was a waste of 4 hours on the only full day we had to spend in Yosemite. We couldn’t wait to get back to our rental car and do the exploring/hiking ourselves! I’m giving it a 3 for at least being able to see the spectacular views!! For an hour :/'\n",
      " 'I booked the 8:30 am Glacier Tour shuttle one-way from Yosemite Lodge to Glacier Point. The day before the tour, I stopped by the Activities desk in the Lodge, and it turns out the confirmation email you get when booking on-line won’t get you on the shuttle- instead, you have to pick up actual tickets at the Activities desk. Well, hey, maybe that’s something they should have mentioned in the confirmation email… They also said that we should show up about 10 minutes early, and line up under the awning outside the lobby.At 8:30 am, the crowd outside the Lodge was asked to form two lines for the two buses- one for the round-trip tour and one for the one-way tour. The round-trip bus loads first. Note that neither of the two buses makes any stops on the way to Glacier Point and they arrive at about the same time, so it doesn’t matter which bus you take up there if you’re going one-way.We had Bill as our bus driver and tour guide, and he was pretty interesting and funny overall, careful to slow the bus at interesting view points and remind us to scan for wildlife. We arrived at 10:07 am. Since we planned to hike down to Yosemite Valley, we only spent about a half hour at Glacier Point, but the views of Half Dome and Yosemite Valley from up there were amazing. In particular, it was crazy to see both Nevada and Vernal Falls from so far off, and realize that we would be hiking down alongside them in only a few hours. Be sure to walk to the actual Glacier Point for the best views.Tips: Heading up, try to sit on the right side of the bus- the views are better. Be sure to trade in your shuttle confirmation email for tickets. Also, as of mid-June the bathrooms at Glacier Point were closed due to plumbing problems- replaced with temporaries, I believe.'\n",
      " 'Absolutely breathtaking!  I highly recommend the bus tour up and either hike or bus back down.  It will depend on how much time you have.  The guide was extremely knowledgable and educates you all the way up and down!  Our guide was Bill and he has been doing the tour for 25 years.'\n",
      " \"We took the 4 hour Glacier Point Bus Tour we had learned about from the Yosemite web site. We chose the one starting at 8:30 considering it gets more crowed in the afternoon.  Tickets are retrieved at the Yosemite Valley Lodge Tour Desk at least 15 minutes prior to your tour departure time.  The bus pulls up right in front of Yosemite Valley Lodge and the line starts forming early.  You see El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome, and Yosemite Falls in Yosemite Valley.  The bus stops at Tunnel View and Glacier Point.Our tour guide was Bill Fontana who had many years of experience.  He was a great guide telling stories of Yosemite's history and incredibly knowledgeable about the park.  We spent an hour on Glacier Point which gave incredible views of the entire valley.  There were bathrooms at Glacier Point and a wheelchair accessible trail.This was a great place to take in the views of Half Dome.  On the way back to Yosemite Village we stopped and got out at Tunnel View.  There are so many beautiful spots and Tunnel View is spectacular. We also stopped at a spot in the valley for pictures of Half Dome and Bridalveil Fall.More than half of the people on the bus took the challenging 4 mile trail back to Yosemite Valley choosing to hike rather than taking the bus back.  If you choose this option it is a lessor fee than the full tour.The bus was a regular bus with padded seats and a restroom at the rear. One person in our party has limited mobility.  She was able to climb the stairs of the bus and the wheel chair was stowed in the luggage compartment below.  If she could not have used the bus steps she had the option when making the reservation to let them know she would need a bus with a wheel chair lift.\"\n",
      " 'We took a tour that started at the Yosemite Valley Lodge to Glacier Point. The tour was 4 hours long and we were in a large bus. Our guide, Stephanie, was excellent. She suggested that everyone stay in their same seats throughout the tour so that you can catch sight of locations coming and going. Glacier Point was spectacular and we had close to one hour to enjoy ourselves for pictures and viewing. You can take a one way tour and walk 4 miles back to the lodge. You are going downhill. The bus ride up to Glacier Point encompasses lots of \"S\" turns----and narrow roads. It was nice to have someone else driving, it be able to sit back and enjoy lots of information about Yosemite and how it is protected as a gorgeous National Park. We did see the remains of the Ferguson Fire, too.']\n"

Such cool views of the falls and the climb was fun, saw a few rainbows too. We then continued up to Nevada Falls, which has spectacular views of the valley. The hike from Vernal to Nevada is pretty brutal and you're up toward altitude - top of Nevada is roughly 6000' elevation but the views at the top are worth it.

       "      <td>Glacier Point at about 7000 ft elevation can be reached by car, shuttle bus (but not during the pandemic) or several strenuous hikes from Yosemite Valley. Even if you can’t walk well, you still get stellar views. If you can hike several miles there are a lot of options on where to go from here. Most people enjoy the short but steep hike to the geology hut. From there you can see the Yosemite Valley floor below, Yosemite Falls in it’s entirety. From Washburn Point about 1/4 mile before you reach the Glacier Point Parking Lot, you can see the entire length of the mist trail with Vernal and Nevada Falls, and the upper 1/4 of Illilouette Fall. (Here you can get a good view of some of the Panorama Trail, which starts at Glacier Point, and goes past all 3 of these waterfalls, about 8 miles to The Valley below).The star of Glacier Point is Half Dome. It’s so large and seemingly so close it feels like you can touch it! Photo opps abound. The Four Mile Trail starts here, going to Yosemite Valley in 4.4 miles and 3,200 ft elevation loss. The first mile is more of a rim trail, and loses/gains only 250 feet. Walk to the point where the switchbacks start, and turn around to retrace your steps. It’s a mile of stellar views of Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains - at a fraction of the effort it takes to hike the entire trail. The road to Glacier Point is not open year round. Check road conditions before going. Wintry conditions or fire can close the road. Generally it’s open end of May through October. If it’s open during your visit, even if pressed for time, this is a must-do! Bring your lunch and sit on the steps of the amphitheater!</td>\n",

       "      <td>This attraction/view will truly take your breath away!  And, it's accessible via road before you go through Tunnel View.  In fact, you may want to take the right turn at the entrance as you are driving in before proceeding further into Yosemite Valley.  Once you make the right turn, you'll drive some distance before arriving at this remarkable vista point.  For us, driving up we didn't see much traffic, even with the limited capacity during the coronavirus period.  However, once we \"arrived\" at the vista point and parked, we came upon quite a group of tourists (much like Tunnel View).  One can only imagine what it must be like during \"normal\" park periods.  We were able to find a parking spot right away.  Walking from there to the vista point is only a relatively short distance.  You'll see Half Dome standing out first, and some helpful signage along the sidewalk area, including restrooms.  Have your photography equipment ready and loaded because you will want to take many shots of this area.  Whether it's phone camera or regular camera, be prepared to take multiple shots to capture it all.  Take your time to take in the beauty and majesty of this natural wonder.  Even in mid-summer, you will find several of the falls still flowing if you look close enough.  We found both Nevada and Vernal Falls with water flowing.  That made up for missing Yosemite Falls water flowing.  You may also wish to take the walking/hiking paths that permeate the perimeter of Glacier Point.  There's a very famous vantage point that Ansel Adams made famous nearby.  This is a \"CAN'T MISS\" part of the Yosemite Park experience.  So, get up there.</td>\n",

       "4                             This attraction/view will truly take your breath away!  And, it's accessible via road before you go through Tunnel View.  In fact, you may want to take the right turn at the entrance as you are driving in before proceeding further into Yosemite Valley.  Once you make the right turn, you'll drive some distance before arriving at this remarkable vista point.  For us, driving up we didn't see much traffic, even with the limited capacity during the coronavirus period.  However, once we \"arrived\" at the vista point and parked, we came upon quite a group of tourists (much like Tunnel View).  One can only imagine what it must be like during \"normal\" park periods.  We were able to find a parking spot right away.  Walking from there to the vista point is only a relatively short distance.  You'll see Half Dome standing out first, and some helpful signage along the sidewalk area, including restrooms.  Have your photography equipment ready and loaded because you will want to take many shots of this area.  Whether it's phone camera or regular camera, be prepared to take multiple shots to capture it all.  Take your time to take in the beauty and majesty of this natural wonder.  Even in mid-summer, you will find several of the falls still flowing if you look close enough.  We found both Nevada and Vernal Falls with water flowing.  That made up for missing Yosemite Falls water flowing.  You may also wish to take the walking/hiking paths that permeate the perimeter of Glacier Point.  There's a very famous vantage point that Ansel Adams made famous nearby.  This is a \"CAN'T MISS\" part of the Yosemite Park experience.  So, get up there.   \n",

      "['I have been through this Trail twice.  First time was in June 2008 on the way to Half Dome and as the fall was in full blast, it was not a \"mist\" trail, it was more like a \"freaking thunderstorming turning over a bucket\" trail.  This time around I came down the mist trail on the Panorama Trail and as it was August, I barely got misted.  This is a pretty spectacular trail and a relatively short hike from Happy Isles (2 miles to the top or Vernal Fall or something like that).  It\\'s worth a hike up to the top, but use the mist trail, not the John Muir trail.  '\n",
      " 'Do not sleep in.  We were on the Mist Trail by 7:30 a.m.  We also walked up to Nevada Fall and came back down the John Muir Trail.  There were not crowds until about 11:00 a.m.'\n",
      " \"The mist trail is a very strenuous hike but worth it.  If you don't think you can do it, then there's always the John Muir trail to the top of Nevada Falls.  The John Muir trail is easier but still pretty difficult.  We hiked to the top of the Nevada Falls via the Mist trail but hiked back down via the John Muir trail.\"\n",
      " \"We visited Yosemite for four days and had entered the lottery to climb Half Dome. I was pretty disappointed when we didn't get it, but what ya gonna do? We wanted to do a long hike and decided on the Mist Trail to the Panorama Trail to Glacier Point, and then back down to the valley via Four Mile Trail. Mist Trail was AWESOME! And the mist is no joke...you get soaked! We had raincoats, and I was glad we did to protect my camera. Besides the amazing experience of climbing up (a lot of the trail is steep stairs) through the mist and seeing the beautiful Vernal and Nevada Falls, there were rainbows in the canyon, so close that if they had been tangible, we could have touched them. It was truly magical. While we went on to the Panorama and Four Mile trail, which was almost 14 miles, if you just do the Mist Trail and want to come back down, I would recommend descending on the John Muir Trail, which is to the right of the Mist Trail. The Mist Trail is very steep and slippery and I would imagine difficult to descend. IMO, this is one hike not to be missed!\"\n",

Definitely take the time to get a different view of Yosemite and the valley.  There are bathrooms in the parking lot.You can hike to Sentinel Dome from Glacier point.  We chose to drive down to the Taft Point / Sentinel Dome Trail head to hike to Sentinel Point and then Taft Point.  It is a but longer of a hike to Sentinel Dome from the Taft Point trail head than from Glacier point but supposedly not as steep.

      "[\"Here is the most important thing to know about all the falls in Yosemite Park.  I have seen a number of people complaining in reviews that they were here in summer, fall, winter, whatever, and the falls were anemic. In California, it does not rain from late spring through mid-fall, and there is no water. The spectacular falls rely on spring snow melt, and so are at their best in early to mid spring.  Even in winter, when it begins to rain, rainfall alone is not enough to really get the falls going, it is when the snowpack melts that they thunder and roar.  So if it is your goal to see the falls at their best, it is essential you plan a spring trip.Yosemite Falls is one spectacular fall.  Well, actually, it is a 3fer! While it is not wide, it is reportedly the tallest waterfall in the U.S.  The upper fall plunges straight down from where Yosemite Creek pours over the edge on its way to join the Merced River.  It is the tallest and most dramatic section of the falls, foaming and frothing on its way down.  The falls then tumble through a series of cascades that are hard to see from most vantage points, before lunching themselves into the final, narrow dive of the lower falls.  At the bottom of the lower falls is an excellent area to view the lower falls fairly up close; further back along the trail leading to the bottom are great views of both upper and lower falls.  Expect to get a little damp from the spray at the bottom of the falls, especially if it's a breezy day. If the falls are in full roar, you will be able to feel the thunder in your chest.\"\n",
      " 'The lower fall is spectacular and if we had enough time we would have walked to the top to see the upper fall.'\n",
      " 'Easy trail to the bottom of the Lower Falls. From that point you can see Upper and Lower Falls together. Amazing.'\n",
      " 'Take the short trail to the base of the falls.  From here you can see just the lower falls.  Walk out on Cooks Meadow, or go to Swinging bridge and see both upper and lower falls, but from farther away'\n",
      " 'Since the Yosemite Falls are some of the longest in the world, they are a must-see.  The trail to get to the Lower part of the falls is an easy hike, but to get a view of the whole Upper and Lower Falls, you only need to go to a place near the restrooms (which, by the way, are pretty nice flushies).  So if a hike is out of the question, you can still see the falls.  We went in the spring when the falls were roaring . . . we loved it']\n"

Conness, Mt. Dana, and the Cathedral Range, and the view from Olmstead Point of Half Dome and Clouds Rest from a much different vantage point than from Yosemite Valley. And the drive up (or especially down) the east side of Tioga Pass to Lee Vining and Mono Lake is exhilarating...although those with a fear of heights might want to think twice about that portion of the road. There's a pullout on the east side of the pass that offers a great view down Lee Vining Canyon and far beyond to the White Mountains on a clear day. Lots of options for things to do right around Tioga Pass itself - the meadows around there are beautiful, you can hike to the top of Mt. Dana, Gaylor Peak, or Tioga Peak, drive up to Saddlebag Lake and hike the 20 Lakes Basin, fish at one of the lakes near the pass, etc. So many people don't see Yosemite from anywhere other than the Valley, and maybe Glacier Point, but there is so much more to see in the high country along the Tioga Road.\"\n",
      " 'While visiting Tuolome we stayed up at the Tioga Pass Resort right in Tioga Pass. It is an astounding drive down to Lee Vining through this pass - at the top of the pass there are many great trail heads to alpine lakes and peaks - gorgeous night skies!'\n",
      " 'Very beautiful with beautiful lakes but as soon as we saw sonoma pass we thought tioga pass is famous but we loved Sonoma pass more. tioga pass had beautiful stream and beautiful lakes, unfortunately some lakes were bounded so we cant touch water but loved it'\n",
      " 'Crossing Tioga pass provides an extrenely scenic route from Yosemite to Las Vegas (optionally through Death Valley) passing by highlights such as Olmsted point, Lake Tenaya, Tuolumne Meadows and Mono lake. The drive from Yosemite to Vegas takes about 12 hours including some stops underway.Tioga pass is at an elevation of 9945 ft and hence enough snow must have disappeared for it to open. When we visited late May 2014 (a year of early opening of the pass) there was still plenty snow visible. Information about the opening of the pass and current conditions can be found at http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/conditions.htm']\n"

It is first encountered as you drive through the Yosemite Tunnel and stop at the tunnel viewpoint. El Capitan dominates the landscape to the left, just opposite the Bridalveil Falls to the right of your view at this location. While driving in the valley, you can pull over from Northside Drive at the El Capitan Meadow and with binoculars, you can spot rock climbers scaling El Capitan. Simply look in the crevices and you'll seem them, tiny specks of colour upon the rock face. The sun shines nicely against El Capitan from late morning onward, allowing nice photographs to be taken during much of the day. When skies are clear and blue, it is a wonderful land formation to see as part of your Yosemite National Park experience.\"\n",

      "[\"Here is the most important thing to know about all the falls in Yosemite Park.  I have seen a number of people complaining in reviews that they were here in summer, fall, winter, whatever, and the falls were anemic. In California, it does not rain from late spring through mid-fall, and there is no water. The spectacular falls rely on spring snow melt, and so are at their best in early to mid spring.  Even in winter, when it begins to rain, rainfall alone is not enough to really get the falls going, it is when the snowpack melts that they thunder and roar.  So if it is your goal to see the falls at their best, it is essential you plan a spring trip.Yosemite Falls is one spectacular fall.  Well, actually, it is a 3fer! While it is not wide, it is reportedly the tallest waterfall in the U.S.  The upper fall plunges straight down from where Yosemite Creek pours over the edge on its way to join the Merced River.  It is the tallest and most dramatic section of the falls, foaming and frothing on its way down.  The falls then tumble through a series of cascades that are hard to see from most vantage points, before lunching themselves into the final, narrow dive of the lower falls.  At the bottom of the lower falls is an excellent area to view the lower falls fairly up close; further back along the trail leading to the bottom are great views of both upper and lower falls.  Expect to get a little damp from the spray at the bottom of the falls, especially if it's a breezy day. If the falls are in full roar, you will be able to feel the thunder in your chest.\"\n",
      " 'It is best to see these falls from Glacier Point.  They can be viewed from Yosemite Valley but I could only see on fall.'\n",
      " \"Often by August the falls are dry so see the falls earlier in the tear if possible>  If you're in the valley it's hard not to see the falls\"\n",
      " \"Again, you can see Yosemite Falls all over the Valley. Your eye is drawn to them all the time - I'd compare the falls with Trummelbach Falls in the Wengen/Lauterbrunnen valley in Switzerland.\"\n",

      "['Vernal Fall is the closer of two with Nevada being further.  If you are looking for adventure and are in good shape, then do the Nevada Falls hike.  We took the John Muir trail to Nevada and it was beautiful!!  Then on our way back, we hit the Vernal Fall trail and immediately were immersed in wall to wall people.  Yikes, the Nevada and John Muir trails were almost empty compared to the cattle herding on Vernal.  But, it is a good hike for the elderly and people with small children.  Go early...as in before 9am.'\n",
      " 'The proximity to half dome, and the view of Nevada and Vernal Falls below, make this a must see at Yosemite. '\n",
      " 'To hike to the top of vernal falls is wet and worth every step.  If you are up to it go all the up to Nevada Falls first and work your way down to Vernal Falls'\n",
      " 'Vernal falls is the first water fall you will see on the Happy Isles trail.  Just a twenty minute uphill walk will take you to the bridge to see Vernal Falls.  Continue up the Mist trail to the tops Vernal Falls.  Lots of steps and you may get wet.  Continue on to Nevada falls...another hour from the top of Vernal.  Then on to Half Dome it you made a reservation.  Take the John Muir Trail back down for more great views of the water falls, Clouds Rest, and even Yosemite falls.  I recommend to take a sack lunch and have it at Nevada falls.  Enjoy!'\n",
      " \"The Mist trail from Happy Isles up to Vernal Falls is probably the best trail I've hiked. It was so much fun! The section up the steps with Vernal Falls in front of you is amazing. Be warned though that the trail is steep and you will get wet - make sure to bring a rain coat and pants or a poncho. I hiked it in May after record snowfall so it was flowing high/wide. Such cool views of the falls and the climb was fun, saw a few rainbows too. We then continued up to Nevada Falls, which has spectacular views of the valley. The hike from Vernal to Nevada is pretty brutal and you're up toward altitude - top of Nevada is roughly 6000' elevation but the views at the top are worth it. Can't recommend this hike more.Whether you go to Vernal or Nevada, take the John Muir trail down so as not to be going against traffic on the wet misty steps.\"]\n"
