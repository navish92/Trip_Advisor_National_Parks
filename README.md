# Trip Advisor National Parks

Description: Whether you're a travel aficionado or a once-in-a-blue-moon vacationer, one of the most vital aspects for a successful trip is figuring out how you should spend your time at your destination - which is always a laborious undertaking!  It's very easy to get a huge list of "Must-see" for any place you are planning to visit, but many additional hours of research is required to understand which must-see points fits in with your preferences.

### Objective
Focusing on a single tourism destination - Yosemite National Park, I will be using reviews of attractions listed under "Top Things To Do" on its **Trip Advisor** page, to create a travel preferences based topic model and a corresponding recommendation system. 

Goals: Following are the comprehensive list of goals. Definitely won't be able to achieve them all, but its to help drive the overall direction:
1. Use one national park as proof of concept. Scrape all "Things To Do" & all reviews for each "Thing". Create a summary segregated by sentiment analysis.
1. Present an overall summarized itinerary that can be filtered based on top level preferences and time available.
1. Make a customer facing app that will allow them to interact with above processed National Park.
1. Repeat process for 10+ National Parks and store to be readily accessible.
1. Add an option to be able enter any destination from Trip Advisor, for which the above process can be repeated on the fly.
